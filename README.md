# SleepGuard

This project implements a real-time drowsiness detection system using deep learning. The system utilizes a pre-trained model to identify whether a driver is awake or drowsy by analyzing video input from a webcam.

## Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection using a webcam.
- Uses a deep learning model trained on a driver drowsiness dataset.
- Provides confidence levels for predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd).
